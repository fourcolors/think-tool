Use the reflection tool as a cognitive scratchpad for:
- Chain-of-thought reasoning through complex problems
- Planning your approach before taking actions
- Reflecting on outcomes after completing tasks
- Validating that requirements are met
- Documenting discoveries and learnings
- Creating cognitive checkpoints you can't skip

The tool helps you think step-by-step, improving accuracy and compliance.

      ## Using the reflection tool

      **Key Insight:** Without explicitly outputting thought processes, no deep thinking occurs. This tool creates mandatory cognitive checkpoints that prevent shortcuts and improve accuracy.

      ### When to Use This Tool

      **üîç Before Complex Actions:**
      - Breaking down multi-step problems into manageable pieces
      - Validating all requirements are understood
      - Identifying dependencies and potential blockers
      - Planning the sequence of operations
      - Considering edge cases and failure modes

      **‚úÖ After Completing Tasks:**
      - Confirming all requirements were actually met
      - Documenting unexpected discoveries or learnings
      - Noting any technical debt introduced
      - Identifying follow-up tasks or improvements
      - Validating documentation was updated

      **üß† During Problem Solving:**
      - Working through complex logic step-by-step
      - Debugging by elimination of possibilities
      - Comparing multiple solution approaches
      - Caching important context across operations
      - Creating decision audit trails

      **‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Checkpoints:**
      - Before making irreversible changes
      - After encountering unexpected behavior
      - When switching between different contexts
      - Before responding with uncertainty
      - After tool failures or errors

      ### Format Examples

      **Forward Thinking (built-in <thinking> tag, no tool needed):**
      <thinking>
      I need to implement authentication. Let me break this down:
      1. Check existing auth patterns in the codebase
      2. Set up JWT token generation
      3. Add middleware for route protection
      4. Test with both valid and expired tokens
      </thinking>
      
      **Retrospective Reflection (uses reflection tool):**
      <reflection>
      Authentication implementation complete:
      - Added: JWT-based auth with refresh tokens
      - Learned: Existing middleware made integration smooth
      - Technical debt: Need to add rate limiting
      - Next: Update API documentation with auth requirements
      </reflection>
      
      **Problem Solving (uses reflection tool for complex reasoning):**
      <reflect>
      Debugging slow API responses:
      - Symptom: 5+ second response times on user queries
      - Hypothesis 1: Database queries missing indexes - CONFIRMED
      - Hypothesis 2: N+1 query problem - Also found this
      - Solution: Added compound indexes and query batching
      - Result: Response time now <200ms
      </reflect>

      Remember: <thinking> tags are for planning ahead, while the reflection tool creates checkpoints for reflection and complex reasoning.

      ## Reflection Pattern Examples

      ### After completing a task:
      <reflection>
      Task completion reflection:
      - Completed: Implemented user authentication with JWT tokens
      - Learned: The existing middleware pattern made integration straightforward
      - Updated: Added authentication setup to CLAUDE.md
      - Next: Need to add rate limiting to protect the endpoints
      </reflection>

      ### After debugging an issue:
      <reflection>
      Debugging reflection:
      - Issue: Users reported slow page loads
      - Found: Database queries were missing indexes
      - Fixed: Added compound indexes on frequently queried fields
      - Documented: Updated performance troubleshooting guide
      - Validated: Load times reduced from 3s to 200ms
      </reflection>

      ### After code review:
      <reflection>
      Code review reflection:
      - Reviewed: Pull request for payment integration
      - Quality: Code follows established patterns, tests are comprehensive
      - Concerns: Need to validate edge cases around currency conversion
      - Action: Requested additional test cases before approval
      </reflection>
