# Think Tool

A powerful Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enhances AI reasoning capabilities by providing a structured thinking environment.

## Overview

Think Tool is a lightweight MCP server built with Deno and FastMCP that provides AI assistants with a dedicated "thinking space" to reason through complex problems before responding. It enables:

- Structured reasoning through complex tasks
- Step-by-step evaluation of rules and requirements
- Verification of planned actions against policies
- Creation of domain-specific thinking frameworks

## Features

- **Structured Thinking**: Dedicated space for reasoning through complex problems
- **Policy Verification**: Check that planned actions comply with all relevant policies
- **Domain-Specific Frameworks**: Create custom thinking steps for different scenarios
- **Thought Logging**: Record thinking processes for transparency and debugging

## Installation

### Using JSR (JavaScript Registry)

The Think Tool MCP server is available on JSR. You can install it using one of the following methods:

#### Deno Projects

```bash
deno add @sterling/think-tool
```

#### Direct Execution with Deno

```bash
deno run -A jsr:@sterling/think-tool
```

### Platform-Specific Installation

#### Claude Desktop

To configure Think Tool with Claude Desktop:

1. Open Claude Desktop and click on Claude menu â†’ Settings
2. In the Settings window, click on "Developer" in the left sidebar
3. Click "Edit Config" to open the configuration file location
4. Create or edit the `claude_desktop_config.json` file with the following content:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "think-tool": {
      "command": "deno",
      "args": ["run", "-A", "jsr:@sterling/think-tool"],
      "type": "stdio",
      "pollingInterval": 30000,
      "startupTimeout": 30000,
      "restartOnFailure": true
    }
  }
}
```

5. Save the file and restart Claude Desktop

The configuration file is typically located at:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- Linux: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

##### Verification

After restarting Claude Desktop, you should see a hammer icon at the bottom of the chat interface. Clicking this icon should show the "think" tool is available.

#### Cursor

Add the following to your Cursor MCP configuration file (`~/.cursor/mcp_servers.json`):

```json
{
  "servers": [
    {
      "name": "Think Tool",
      "enabled": true,
      "server": {
        "type": "command",
        "command": "deno",
        "args": ["run", "-A", "jsr:@sterling/think-tool"]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Zed

Add the following to your Zed configuration in `~/.config/zed/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "assistant": {
    "context_servers": [
      {
        "name": "Think Tool",
        "enabled": true,
        "server": {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "deno",
          "args": ["run", "-A", "jsr:@sterling/think-tool"]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Self-Hosted Setup

If you prefer to run the server directly:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sterling/think-tool.git
   cd think-tool
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   deno cache server.ts
   ```

3. Run the server:
   ```bash
   deno run server.ts
   ```

For development with hot-reloading:

```bash
deno task dev
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the Think Tool MCP server:

1. Check the Claude Desktop logs:

   - macOS: `tail -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log`
   - Windows: Check logs in `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Claude\logs`

2. Ensure Deno is installed:

   - Verify with: `deno --version`
   - If not installed, follow instructions at [deno.land](https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation)

3. Check that the paths in your configuration are correct and use absolute paths when necessary

4. Restart Claude Desktop after making configuration changes

## Usage

### Creating Domain-Specific Thinking Frameworks

For optimal use, create domain-specific thinking frameworks at the beginning of your AI conversations:

```
<think_tool_step_1>
Technical Implementation Framework:
1. REQUIREMENTS: Define precise specifications and acceptance criteria
2. RESEARCH: Gather all necessary information from documentation
3. ARCHITECTURE: Design clean interfaces with proper separation of concerns
4. IMPLEMENTATION: Write code following best practices
...
</think_tool_step_1>

<think_tool_step_2>
Problem Analysis:
1. What are the precise requirements of this task?
2. What information do I need to gather?
3. What potential solutions should I consider?
...
</think_tool_step_2>
```

## Technical Details

The server is built with:

- **Deno**: A secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript
- **FastMCP**: A framework for building Model Context Protocol servers
- **Zod**: A TypeScript-first schema validation library
